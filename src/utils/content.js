        bio: `Harrison Oates is a fifth-year student at the Australian National University studying Advanced Computing (Research & Development) (Hons.) and Politics, Philosophy, and Economics, with a focus on artificial intelligence.

His work sits at the intersection of AI systems, governance, and sociotechnical risk. He has published research in established AI venues, primarily in automated planning and formal methods, and is broadly interested in how advanced AI systems are designed, governed, and deployed in real-world contexts.

Harrison currently serves as Vice Chair of the Youth Coalition of the ACT and on the council of Linux Australia. He has contributed to national and international discussions on technology policy and online safety through UNICEF Australia, Project Rockit, the eSafety Commissioner’s Youth Council, and as part of the Australian youth delegation to the 2024 Debate to Regulate Online Safety Summit.`,

Many young people today are aware that emerging technologies have a huge impact on their lives, yet feel powerless to change them.

We are often told that the tech we live with, such as AI, is "inevitable" and "cannot be understood or regulated." **At Youth Tech Net, we challenge that narrative.**

At Youth Tech Net, we firmly believe in the **sociotechnical nature of technology**.

We believe young people have the right, and capability, to be involved in the design and regulation of the tech that directly affects us.

We ask to be **actively included** in the sociotechnical systems we live in, not **subjected** to them.

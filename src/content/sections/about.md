Youth Tech Net brings together a network of young people with a diversity of experience, so we can weave a better sociotechnical future.

At Youth Tech Net, we firmly believe in the sociotechnical nature of emerging technologies, and that young people have right, and capability, to be involved in solving the problems these technologies cause.

We believe in a future for our generation where technology supports the wellbeing of all people.
